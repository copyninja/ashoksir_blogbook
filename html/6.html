WHICH TECHNOLOGY WILL LAST?<br />Our computer seems outdated before we walk out of the computer store. And yet some innovations of the past, equally revolutionary in their day, endure for generations. There's a reason why we can't reinvent the wheel: Some things just can't be significantly improved upon.<br />Sure, people looking for a new angle on an old concept here and there achieve little evolutionary tweaks over time. But unlike high-tech gadgetry, which seems to be rendered obsolete as fast as it is invented, revolutions in everyday items are rare. Examples are: pencil, hammer, button, comb.<br />While any gadget can always be improved, sometimes further innovations appear to be mere tweaks. An example: shirt-buttons, whatever their colour or material, are still shirt buttons. And no one is ever going to reinvent the wheel. But the wheels on an automobile are very different from those on a bullock cart! Also bullock cartwheels themselves have changed!<br />It seems there is no tool that can't be improved. The change may be related to cost, reliability, functionality, environmental impact or some other attribute. Technologies only seem immutable if we define them broadly. Some ideas simply represent fundamental solutions to problems, example basket. Originally made from plant fibres, it's now as likely to be a cloth, paper or plastic bag or a toolbox. But the idea of a container is still a basic thing that is difficult to improve upon, so much so that bags, baskets and boxes all basically resemble one another. Some ideas are just so good they determine what comes afterwards. People make ergonomic improvements, or they make economic improvements, but the core idea stays the same. The transistor, the tiny electronic switch that serves as the basis for the computer, is a recent invention but a fundamental idea. Computer engineers are constantly working to make these tiny switches smaller and smaller, but they are not searching for an alternative to using tiny switches.<br />Everything is going to be obsolete but not ideas.
