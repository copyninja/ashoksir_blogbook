<h1>The new turncoats</h1>
The new turncoats!<br />The one message we keep on receiving on our cellphones is the one intimating change of number of the sender. Some of the messages just inform that they would be changing over to a new number and request us to save their new number. Others even go to extent of announcing the change over date. They expect us to remember the date and bring the change into effect on the scheduled date! I am one of the lazy kind, find it boring to save the new number. More so, because, my cellphone has no facility to save the new number with old name. Hence I have to write down the new number in a sheet of paper and then edit the previous entries of the sender.<br />Normally people resist change. I am continuing with my old number and handset for quite a long time. But eveyone else seems to relish changing their numbers. Those who have lot of debts, normally change their numbers, just to escape from their debtors. For his friends he would send a sms and intimate change of number, while not doing so for debtors. One of my computer technician told me he had changed his numbers to get rid of some of his “bad” clients. That made me proud as he signalled that I was not a bad client.<br />Many change their number as they are lured by some offers of service providers. Concessional tariff, free sms is enough for few. Later if they find a tempting offer from their old service provider they would come back to “tavarumane”. I wonder what our turncoat politician friends do with their mobile numbers.<br />I guess CDMA subscriber are of loyal kind, otherwise they would not opted for that service knowing fully well that they cannot switch service. Even they may have to change if their service provider himself switches from CDMA technology to GSM technology, as Ambani group intends to do.<br />There is one solution for this problem. If service providers allow switch numbers one service provider to the other, one need not change their number just to change over to a new service provider. Also new handsets which accommodate more than one SIM card, allows users simultaneously get service from as many service providers, as the number of SIM cards.<br />This makes me think, what would have happened if changing life partners would have been as easy as changing provider, how many would have continued with their old partners!<br />*Ashokkumar A
