<h1>Homeopathy treatment: Tips</h1>
TIPS TO NEW PATIENTS :HOW TO PRESENT YOUR ILLNESS FOR & QUICK AND BEST RESULTS with a Homeopath (Source: Dr Vasanth Kumar Rao, Mangalore)<br />(Scientific medicine hence forth referred as - allopathic / western/ scientific medicine)Like many others you too opted Homeopathy for your illness after the scientific evaluation, correct diagnosis &amp; the very specific treatment. Yet you repeatedly get back the symptoms get the same treatment probably on multiple occasions stretching from few weeks to months or years. Well, the naming of a disease is very good in Modern scientific medicine. Then how & why these repeated failures? / Or drop outs?<br />In Homeopathy we feel that so far YOU have got the disease specific treatment for one &amp; all irrespective individual merits- or " FIT " the person, thus ignoring the" individual per se " .<br />In Homeopathy the treatment is aimed at the individual person - thus titrating the" unique individualized" treatment possible only from the " Art & philosophy of Homeopathy. --. Looks really ridiculous when you look from the scientific angle!<br />Like no man is alike both in external appearance as well as individual emotional &amp; mental make up, like wise the very same disease will throw some additional individualizing features which must be explored carefully during the consultation. This requires more time, patience & one has to be" closer personally " to the Homeo doctor in all dealings, which consumes considerable time for the correct planning of the treatment.<br />In addition to the named disease, each one of us has some peculiar, queer, rare &amp; strange symptoms & they come out of the "disease description ". again -looks unscientific to a conventional doctor. E.g.- some people are undue chilly, likes to be covered in least cold weather &amp; on the contrary some feel very warmth even in cold or temperate weather, like to be uncovered. Some like sweets, some hate the same, some opt salty dishes, some may choose chilled water or drinks & yet some choose a boiling cup of Coffee or Tea. Some are never thirsty, some are very thirsty, some will always suffer constipation (tendency) &amp; some never have this complaint. Some are very nervous, can not stay lonely, need company some feel easily angered, for trifles, some are very hasty & never do things in order, some are great perfectionists which keeps them unhappy when others at home or office do not practice so. Some pains aggravate only at night or evenings, others may get worse only in mornings. Some are very excited, some are unduly quiet, some are indifferent, some are jealous, some are easily frightened, some are easily irritated, some are readily &amp; easily tearful, some are easily hurt even from one "word" either at home or office, some brood on unpleasant things, so we have innumerable permutations & combinations of emotional &amp; mental complaints. The "totality" of the existing disease complaints & the respective definite set of emotional or mental features or aggravating or ameliorating factors i.e. "disease modifiers are " additional qualifying symptoms" - to a" complete totality " representing that " individual per se." If an attempt is done to pick up these set of total symptoms equated with a single remedy in Homeopathy i.e. for application of the" Law of Similars ". We proceed to the final prescription after this long &amp; cumbersome exercise, for complete evaluation. Can we ignore the individualizing symptoms? Never. This is the best way a treatment can be filtered to the given case, as most fitting, but would be illogical & utterly useless for another person who has similar "Diagnosis but has his own emotional &amp; mental features as well as disease modifiers subjectively experienced, can not be explored from any technological means. As this exercise is time consuming & need a frank &amp; honest approach as your doctor needs minutest personal details which in the beginning of the illness either ignored or feel unduly cumbersome & seek quick cure from the conventional medicine. Unfortunately some over say some under say some incorrectly say or remain suspicious that the doctor is unnecessarily probing more of personal details &amp; disregard the very procedure. However in Homeopathy one needs to qualify the symptoms i.e. to individualize the treatment BE HONEST OPEN MINDED & FRANK to express your illness, to expect the doctor to deliver the BEST CARE &amp; A COMPLETE CURE.<br />In certain occasions you might have been suffering 2-3 major complaints being looked after by 2-3 specialists yet not getting cure for any of the complaints. Naso bronchial allergy may be the present complaint but preceding 2months the same person might have been suffering from frequent loose stools or some recurring skin complains, but being under the care of 2- 3 specialists who treat at their best yet are unable to deliver the right cure because of the disintegrated approach. This is unlikely to happen if one reveals the connected previous complaints or rarely associated with current illness. In Homeopathy a set of complaints comprising of emotional mental or modifying factors may indicate a near or one & same remedy for all the presenting for the unseen past complaints. Too. In Homeopathy a remedy may cover the multi systemic complaints, hence one need not seek symptomatic treatment as in conventional medicine. Women in reproductive age group need to mention any important complaint like association with the presenting medical complaints. Too frequent or very much delayed menses in a Migraine patient may indicate a right remedy to correct the menses as well as the headache that has been bothering her for years.<br />Stress is a part of today's living more so in urban set up, &amp; some show great distress even for trifles, both in home or office or in school or in college. But the ultimate effect of the "distress" will be targeted on different organs in different individuals. So in Homeopathy, we need to analyse the role of stresses in personal level.<br />Homeopathy has some areas of interest in children's illnesses, also in teen agrees, adolescents, exam going students, anticipatory anxiety in public speakers in professionals, for the care of the skin in minimizing acne (pimples) oily face in puberty people, to minimize the offensive mouth odour or offensive sweat.<br />Some pose a common dilemma among all new comers to Homeopathy that whether they can continue some modern medicines. All people taking long-term treatment need to show the prescription or the tablets & other relevant details. Some drugs cannot &amp; should not be stopped immediately but can be tapered gradually or stopped over a definite time. However minimum medication is ideally desired if one cannot stop the long medication.<br />If one is on frequent short-term medication with other systems of Medicine either Modern or Ayurveda, must better visit the Homeo doctor after a gap of 1-2 weeks.<br />With the administration of a right remedy will show favourable response with in a period of 10-20 days in all chronic illnesses, by couple of doses to 6-9 doses or by 2-3 days in acute or sub acute cases.<br />For all inter current illnesses like cold cough fever - viral it is ideal to keep a Homeopathic kit in patients coming from long distances. Others nearby either can report individually or send someone to collect few doses for 2-3 days only. , but resist to medicate themselves or to take allopathic tablets or injections.<br />Some laymen over emphasize the restriction of coffee, tea, garlic or onions during Homeo treatment. According to our Master with moderation in the above list Homeo medicines remain unaffected as they are not crude medicines - they are potentised Remedies.<br />Very rarely some sensitive patients may exhibit a sudden aggravation of the illness, which is a good sign - a sign of “Healing crisis”, when, identified better to stop temporarily & report to the doctor by a week or so for clarification, but not to give up the treatment.<br />Your cooperation is very important through out the work up &amp; future follow-ups.<br />Some hesitate to say that Homeo medicines are dummy pills & the doctor cures by mere faith. This is a serious misconception. We treat animals &amp; young infants who cannot brought under this belief readily unlike adults, get instant cures.<br />Homeo medicines when not indicated or wrongly taken for prolonged period can do major harm to produce a set of complaints " thus not innocuous" or" very safe" is equally a false notion. . No modern tests can diagnose the "drug disease-" & the only way to get a cure is to stop the wrong remedy taken with a false belief it is always" absolutely safe ".<br />Living a healthy life is a great blessing / a gift &amp; remember this is certainly possible by your honest &amp; humble effort by resorting to Homeopathy – by holistic means.
